# ‚ùì ProShield FAQ (v1.2.4)

This FAQ covers the most common questions, problems, and solutions for running ProShield.  
If your issue isn‚Äôt listed here, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/snazzyatoms/ProShield/issues).

---

## ‚úÖ General

**Q: What Minecraft versions are supported?**  
A: ProShield supports **1.18 ‚Üí 1.21** on **Spigot and Paper**.  
Newer versions will be tested as they release.

---

**Q: Do I need a permissions plugin?**  
A: **No.** ProShield works with Bukkit‚Äôs native permissions out-of-the-box.  
If you run **LuckPerms, PermissionsEx, or GroupManager**, ProShield integrates seamlessly.

---

**Q: How do players claim land?**  
A: Players can claim in **two ways**:

üîπ **Compass GUI**  
- Use the ProShield Compass (right-click).  
- Slot 11 ‚Üí Claim current chunk  
- Slot 13 ‚Üí Claim info (owner + trusted players)  
- Slot 15 ‚Üí Unclaim  
- Slot 31 ‚Üí Help (shows commands based on your permissions)  
- Slot 33 ‚Üí Admin menu (if you have admin perms)  

üîπ **Commands**  
- `/proshield claim` ‚Üí Claim your current chunk  
- `/proshield unclaim` ‚Üí Unclaim  
- `/proshield info` ‚Üí View claim details  

---

**Q: I didn‚Äôt get the compass when joining. What‚Äôs wrong?**  
A: Check these points:  
- You are **OP** (ops automatically get the **Admin Compass**) or have `proshield.compass` / `proshield.admin`.  
- In `config.yml`, `autogive.compass-on-join: true`.  
- Use `/proshield compass` to get one manually if missing.  

---

**Q: Can I reload configs without restarting?**  
A: Yes! Run `/proshield reload`.  
This refreshes **config.yml**, protections, claim expiry, and **role settings** without restarting the server.  
üîπ New in **1.2.4**: A **Reload button** is available in the **Admin GUI**.

---

**Q: How does claim expiry work?**  
A: Expiry **automatically removes claims** from inactive players:  
- Enable with `expiry.enabled: true`.  
- `expiry.days` sets the inactivity limit.  
- Runs on **startup** and **daily**.  
- Admins can force it with `/proshield purgeexpired`.

---

**Q: What are Claim Roles?**  
A: Claim Roles let owners assign **different access levels** to trusted players:  
- **Visitor** ‚Üí Walk only, no interaction.  
- **Member** ‚Üí Basic interaction (doors, buttons, levers).  
- **Container** ‚Üí Can use chests, barrels, furnaces.  
- **Builder** ‚Üí Build and break blocks.  
- **Co-Owner** ‚Üí Full access, almost like the owner.  

Configured in `config.yml` and manageable via **commands & GUI**.  
More role customization coming in **v2.0**.

---

**Q: What is Claim Transfer?**  
A: Owners can transfer their claim to another player with:  
- `/proshield transfer <player>`  

---

**Q: What is Claim Preview?**  
A: Use `/proshield preview` to see a **particle outline** of your claim before confirming.  

---

**Q: What is Spawn Guard? (NEW in 1.2.4)**  
A: Spawn Guard prevents claims too close to the **world spawn**:  
- Configurable radius via `spawn.radius`.  
- Default = 32 blocks.  
- Admins with `proshield.admin.bypass` can override it.  

---

**Q: How does Mob Repel work? (NEW in 1.2.4)**  
A: Hostile mobs are **pushed back** at claim borders:  
- Configurable in `protection.mobs.border-repel`.  
- Radius, push force, and tick interval can be changed.  
- Prevents mobs from entering claims at all.  

---

**Q: Where are claims stored? Can I back them up?**  
A: Claims and trust data are stored in:  
`/plugins/ProShield/config.yml`  

‚úÖ Always back up this file (or the full ProShield folder) before updates.

---

**Q: Do I need to delete my config for 1.2.4?**  
A: ‚ö†Ô∏è Yes, in some cases.  
Because of major **config restructuring** in 1.2.4, you may need to:  
1. Stop the server.  
2. Delete `/plugins/ProShield/`.  
3. Restart to regenerate fresh configs.  
4. Reapply your custom edits.

---

**Q: Where do I report bugs or request features?**  
A: Use the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/snazzyatoms/ProShield/issues) or the **Spigot discussion thread**.

---

**Problem:** Need more details for debugging  
‚úÖ Fix:
