---

## ‚úÖ General

**Q: What Minecraft versions are supported?**  
A: ProShield supports **1.18 ‚Üí 1.21** on **Spigot and Paper**.  
Newer versions will be tested as they release.

---

**Q: Do I need a permissions plugin?**  
A: **No.** ProShield works with Bukkit‚Äôs native permissions out-of-the-box.  
If you run **LuckPerms, PermissionsEx, or GroupManager**, ProShield integrates seamlessly.

---

**Q: How do players claim land?**  
A: Players can claim in **two ways**:

üîπ **Compass GUI**  
- Use the ProShield Compass (right-click).  
- Slot 11 ‚Üí Claim current chunk  
- Slot 13 ‚Üí Claim info (owner + trusted players)  
- Slot 15 ‚Üí Unclaim  
- Slot 28 ‚Üí Claim Flags menu  
- Slot 30 ‚Üí Expansion Requests (NEW in v1.2.5)  
- Slot 31 ‚Üí Help (shows commands based on your permissions)  
- Slot 32 ‚Üí Admin Tools (if you have admin perms)  

üîπ **Commands**  
- `/proshield claim` ‚Üí Claim your current chunk  
- `/proshield unclaim` ‚Üí Unclaim  
- `/proshield info` ‚Üí View claim details  

---

**Q: I didn‚Äôt get the compass when joining. What‚Äôs wrong?**  
A: Check these points:  
- You are **OP** (ops automatically get the **Admin Compass**) or have `proshield.compass` / `proshield.admin`.  
- In `config.yml`, `autogive.compass-on-join: true`.  
- Use `/proshield compass` to get one manually if missing.  

---

**Q: Can I reload configs without restarting?**  
A: Yes! Run `/proshield reload`.  
This refreshes **config.yml**, **messages.yml**, protections, claims, expiry, and expansions.  
üîπ Since **1.2.4**, a **Reload button** is available in the **Admin GUI**.  
üîπ Expanded in **1.2.5** to also reload expansions.yml.  

---

**Q: How does claim expiry work?**  
A: Expiry **automatically removes claims** from inactive players:  
- Enable with `expiry.enabled: true`.  
- `expiry.days` sets the inactivity limit.  
- Runs on **startup** and **daily**.  
- Admins can force it with `/proshield purgeexpired`.

---

**Q: What are Claim Roles?**  
A: Claim Roles let owners assign **different access levels** to trusted players:  
- **Visitor** ‚Üí Walk only, no interaction.  
- **Member** ‚Üí Basic interaction (doors, buttons, levers).  
- **Container** ‚Üí Can use chests, barrels, furnaces.  
- **Builder** ‚Üí Build and break blocks.  
- **Co-Owner** ‚Üí Full access, almost like the owner.  

Configured in `config.yml` and manageable via **commands & GUI**.  
More role customization coming in **v2.0**.

---

**Q: What is Claim Transfer?**  
A: Owners can transfer their claim to another player with:  
- `/proshield transfer <player>`  

---

**Q: What is Claim Preview?**  
A: Use `/proshield preview` to see a **particle outline** of your claim before confirming.  

---

**Q: What is Spawn Guard? (NEW in 1.2.4)**  
A: Spawn Guard prevents claims too close to the **world spawn**:  
- Configurable radius via `spawn.radius`.  
- Default = 32 blocks.  
- Admins with `proshield.admin.bypass` can override it.  

---

**Q: How does Mob Repel work? (IMPROVED in 1.2.5)**  
A: Hostile mobs are **pushed back** at claim or safezone borders:  
- Configurable in `protection.mobs.border-repel`.  
- Radius, push force, and tick interval can be changed.  
- Since **1.2.5**, mobs inside safezones are also despawned automatically.  
- Pathfinding/targeting into safezones is blocked.  

---

**Q: What are Expansion Requests? (NEW in 1.2.5)**  
A: Players can request more claim blocks through a GUI:  
- Increase/decrease expansion size (+16/+32/+64, -16/-32/-64).  
- Submit to admins for review.  
- Configurable defaults in `config.yml`.  

---

**Q: How do admins handle Expansion Requests? (NEW in 1.2.5)**  
A: Through the **Admin GUI**:  
- **Expansion Requests menu** ‚Üí approve or deny.  
- Denial reasons are pulled from `messages.yml`.  
- History is tracked with pagination for audit.  

---

**Q: What are World Controls? (NEW in 1.2.5)**  
A: A dedicated **Admin-only GUI** to toggle global protections:  
- Fire spread  
- Explosions (TNT/creeper)  
- Mob damage  
- Other environmental flags  

All synced with `config.yml` and applied globally.

---

**Q: Where are claims stored? Can I back them up?**  
A: Claims and trust data are stored in:  
`/plugins/ProShield/config.yml`  

‚úÖ Always back up this file (or the full ProShield folder) before updates.

---

**Q: Do I need to delete my config for 1.2.5?**  
A: ‚ö†Ô∏è Yes.  
Because of major **config and messages.yml restructuring** in 1.2.5, you may need to:  
1. Stop the server.  
2. Delete `/plugins/ProShield/`.  
3. Restart to regenerate fresh configs and messages.  
4. Reapply your custom edits.
